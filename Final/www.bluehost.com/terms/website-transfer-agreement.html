					</li>
				
<ul>

						<li class="item" id="Servicesa">
					<p><b>Website Transfer</b></p><p>The Website Transfer includes the migration of Client data, specified as files, databases and and email accounts, to the extent paid for by Client according to Bluehost's current migration service pricing. This service is provided "AS-IS" and Bluehost Website Transfer assumes no responsibility for the errors, omissions, or other problems related to the Website Transfer Service.</p>

Client shall inform Bluehost Website Transfer of any existing errors, previous conditions, configuration changes, non-standard software, special circumstances or other reasons why the server may not be of a standard configuration or otherwise interfere with Service to be performed by Bluehost, failure to do so negates all responsibility of Bluehost Website Transfer to complete the Service. In the event that a Client with an open project does not make contact, by phone or by email, with Bluehost Website Transfer for a length of time equal to or greater than fourteen days, said Client's open project will be considered an abandoned project at that time and marked as completed by Bluehost. In addition, the Client must make known to Bluehost, in writing by email, any problems or issues related to the Service provided by Bluehost Website Transfer within fourteen days of order completion if Bluehost Website Transfer is to attempt to fix any errors, after which time the contract is complete, and no further work can or will be completed by Bluehost.

					<p><b>Charge Backs</b></p><p>Because the Website Transfer is a service and not a product , full refunds are not available once any kind of service has been rendered to Client. Bluehost Website Transfer prefers working with customers rather then seeing a Charge Back. If Client will contact Bluehost's billing department instead of issuing a charge back, then Bluehost Website Transfer can work with Client to achieve a desired results or an appropriate compromise. Client agrees that a maximum amount of fifty percent of the fees charged to Client for the Service in question during a Charge Back can ever be reimbursed to the Client. Client also agrees that a seventy-five dollar fee per charge back will be charged as a separate charge for any Charge Backs that Client issues.</p>
